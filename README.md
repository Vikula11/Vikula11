### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Viktoria and I am from Germany. 

Currently I am studying Coding & Software Engineering (B.Sc.) at the XU Exponential University in Potsdam but before that I worked as a bank clerk 
in the fraud detection department. I know...completely different ðŸ˜¬

I am interested in App Development and UI/UX. I would love to connect and learn from everyone of you!
